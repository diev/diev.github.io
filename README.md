[![Build Status]][BS lnk]

Dmitrii Evdokimov's Website. 
Using [Jekyll].

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, 
project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without 
all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid 
templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by 
Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind 
[GitHub Pages], which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub 
repositories.

Theme based on [Midnight] originally by [mattgraham].

## The Main Feature

Herewith I try to make a multilanguage site by very simple things used.
Currently there are a Russian (native by default) and an English 
(international) versions available. You can add your language next.
