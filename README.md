Dmitrii Evdokimov's Website. 
Using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, 
project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without 
all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid 
templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by 
Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind 
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites 
right from your GitHub repositories.

Theme based on [Midnight](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight)
